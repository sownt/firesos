# Fire SOS
The situation of fires and explosions in residential areas and households accounts for a high proportion of cases, causing serious damage to people and becoming increasingly complicated and dangerous. Fires often arise at night or during holidays. People are often in charge of using fire and heat sources such as kerosene lamps, and incense sticks, using electrical equipment, and producing and trading inflammable goods in the family, but they do not ensure the safety conditions for fire prevention and fighting, arising fire and explosion incidents and failure to detect incidents in time, leading to fire spread, large fires and property damage, and especially loss of human life. People did not respond in time and did not call the fire protection agencies to rescue in time, leading to unfortunate consequences. When receiving fire alarm calls from victims, the fire protection units arrived, but it was too late.
